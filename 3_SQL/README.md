# Task Breakdown
- As an initial step, I used SQL to check for NULL values. The yearc column (representing the year of construction) also contained some decimal entries, so I extracted their integer parts. For further details, see [SQL Query](https://github.com/taitran0102/House-price-analysis/tree/main/3_SQL). The cleaned dataset resulting from the SQL processing is named [Munich03_SQL.csv](https://github.com/taitran0102/House-price-analysis/tree/main/3_SQL).
- Next, I used Python to detect outliers, since it offers more automated and visual tools.
