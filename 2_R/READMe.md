# Task breakdown
First, the dataset is included in the `LinRegInteractive` package in `R`. We begin by exporting this dataset to a file named [`Munich03.csv`](https://github.com/taitran0102/House-price-analysis/tree/main/2_R). For more details, see the file [`data_exporting.ipynb`](https://github.com/taitran0102/House-price-analysis/blob/main/2_R/data_exporting.ipynb)
