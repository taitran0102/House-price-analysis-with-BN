# House Price Analysis using Bayesian Network
- Abstract: This project applies Bayesian Networks (Directed Graphical Models) to model the probabilistic relationships between features in a housing dataset, such as price, location, area, and number of rooms. The model captures conditional dependencies between variables and enables inference based on observed evidence. The goal is to demonstrate how probabilistic reasoning can support data analysis, decision making, and explainability in real-world problems like real estate pricing.
