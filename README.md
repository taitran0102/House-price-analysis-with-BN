# Project Summary
#### Introduction
This project was originally done as part of a specialized seminar course during my studies. It was not uploaded to GitHub at the time, but I have now revisited and improved it by incorporating additional tools to better explore the dataset. The dataset used in this project is a sampled subset of data originally collected to develop the Rental Price Index for Munich in 2003. Therefore, the objective of this project is to analyze the impact of various factors on rental prices in the city of Munich.
