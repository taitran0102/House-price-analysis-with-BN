#### Introduction:
This project applies **Bayesian Networks** (Directed Graphical Models) to model the probabilistic relationships between features in a housing dataset, such as price, location, area, and number of rooms. The model captures **conditional dependencies** between variables and enables **inference based on observed evidence**. The goal is to demonstrate how **probabilistic reasoning** can support data analysis, decision making, and explainability in real-world problems like real estate pricing.
